# Network-Security-A2
Write a program (in C, C++, C#,
Python, or Java), call it EXPO, to efficiently exponentiate big numbers modulo n as
described in Section 6.3.4.1 of your textbook. Your program should take three positive
numbers as input, one representing the number m, another representing the exponent d to
which m is raised to and the third being n. Write client server programs (in C, C++, C#,
Python, or Java) using TCP sockets where the client (Alice) and the server (Bob) perform
a Diffie Hellman exchange. Use your EXPO program (or function call) to compute the
Diffie Hellman numbers. Let g = 1907, p = 784313, SA = 160011 (Alice’s secret), and SB
= 12067 (Bob’s secret). Your ouput must show the numbers sent by Alice and Bob for the Diffie Hellman
exchange as well the shared key after the exchange.
